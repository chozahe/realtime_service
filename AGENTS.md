# Project: Realtime Gateway (Gleam)

## Goal
Implement a WebSocket realtime gateway according to specs in /docs.

## Architecture
- Event-driven service (Kafka)
- WebSocket server for clients
- Redis for ephemeral state (sessions, routing, presence)
- JWT authentication via JWKS

## Important constraints
- 1 active connection per user
- All Kafka events must be deduplicated by event_id
- WebSocket protocol must follow docs/specs/websocket.md
- Redis keys must follow docs/specs/redis.md
- Kafka payloads must follow docs/specs/kafka.md

## Modules structure
- domain/ → core types and logic
- contracts/ → JSON and Kafka payloads
- ws/ → websocket logic
- kafka/ → consumers and producers
- presence/ → online/offline logic
- receipts/ → delivery/read receipts
- routing/ → message delivery
- infra/ → redis, kafka, http, auth

```

Notes:
- contracts/ describes message formats only
- domain/ contains pure types and rules, without Redis/Kafka/WebSocket details
- infra/ talks to external systems
- feature folders like ws/, presence/, receipts/, routing/ implement use cases
- start simple: if a feature is small, one file is enough; split only when logic grows

## Coding rules
- Do NOT mix domain logic with infrastructure
- Keep functions small and pure when possible
- Do NOT put everything in one file
- Prefer explicit types over raw strings
- Follow feature-based modular structure

## When implementing features
Always:
1. Read corresponding spec from /docs
2. Define types in contracts/ first
3. Then implement logic
4. Then connect infra

## Priority features (implementation order)
1. WebSocket handshake + JWT validation
2. Redis session registry
3. connected event + ping/pong
4. Kafka consumer skeleton + dedup
5. message.created → message.new
6. ack → receipt.delivered
7. presence online/offline
8. typing.start / typing.stop
